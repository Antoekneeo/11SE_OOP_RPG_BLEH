# RPG Lesson: Object-Oriented Programming 


## Project Structure

This project demonstrates OOP concepts in Python with a modular structure:

### Main Files
- `main.py` - Entry point for the game
- `game.py` - Main Game class implementation
- `character.py` - Base Character class
- `boss.py` - Boss class (inherits from Character)
- `weapon.py` - Weapon class
- `game_logger.py` - Game logging functionality
- `console_utils.py` - Console utility functions
- `save_game.py` - Game state persistence

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development plans
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `UML_class_diagram.md` - Class structure and relationships

### Tests
- `tests/` - Directory containing all test files
- `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration
- `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies

## COIPEA: Core OOP Concepts Demonstrated

This code demonstrates all six fundamental Object-Oriented Programming principles (COIPEA):
- **C**lasses and **O**bjects
- **I**nheritance
- **P**olymorphism
- **E**ncapsulation
- **A**bstraction

### 1. Classes and Objects
- The code defines several classes (`GameLogger`, `Weapon`, `Character`, `Boss`, `Game`) that encapsulate data and behavior
- Objects are instantiated from these classes (e.g., player character, bosses, weapons)

### 2. Inheritance
- `Boss` inherits from `Character`, demonstrating class hierarchy
- The `super().__init__()` call in `Boss.__init__` shows proper parent constructor invocation
- Method overriding is shown in `Boss.attack()` which extends the parent's method

### 3. Polymorphism
- Method overriding in `Boss.attack()` demonstrates polymorphism - same method name but different behavior than parent class
- The `attack()` method behaves differently depending on the actual object type (Character vs Boss)
- This allows for treating different object types through a common interface

### 4. Encapsulation
- Each class encapsulates its own data (attributes) and behavior (methods)
- Classes have clear responsibilities and manage their own state
- Objects maintain their internal state and expose functionality through methods
- The `Character` class demonstrates proper encapsulation with:
  - A private `_health` attribute (indicated by the underscore prefix)
  - Public `get_health()` and `set_health()` methods for controlled access
  - Data validation in the setter to ensure health is never negative
  - Consistent use of getters/setters throughout the codebase (e.g., in combat logic)
  - The `Weapon` class is composed within the `Character` class, demonstrating strong composition

### 5. Abstraction
- Classes represent abstract concepts (Character, Weapon, Game) hiding implementation details
- The Game class abstracts away the complexity of game flow management
- Users of the classes only need to understand the interface, not internal workings

### 6. Additional Relationships
- **Composition**: Strong composition between `Character` and `Weapon` (a character "has-a" weapon)
- **Dependency**: `GameLogger` demonstrates a dependency relationship (explicitly mentioned as "dotted line in UML")

## UML Class Diagram Concepts

The code demonstrates several UML class diagram concepts including classes, relationships (inheritance, composition, dependency), and various class members.

For a detailed analysis of UML concepts in this code, see [UML_class_diagram.md](UML_class_diagram.md).

## Design Patterns and Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class has a clear, focused purpose
- Utility functions are separated into logical groups (e.g., `clear_screen`, `press_enter` in console utilities)
- The `GameLogger` class handles all logging functionality
- The `Weapon` class focuses solely on weapon properties and behavior

### 2. Game Loop Pattern
- The `Game.run()` method implements a simple game loop

### 3. Factory Method (simplified)
- `choose_weapon()` acts as a factory for creating weapon configurations

## OOP Learning Value

### 1. Clear Demonstration of OOP Concepts
- **Inheritance**: The `Boss` class extends `Character` and overrides the `attack` method
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getters/setters in `Character` class
- **Composition**: `Character` contains a `Weapon` object
- **Dependency**: `Game` depends on `GameLogger` for logging
- **Polymorphism**: Different attack behaviours between `Character` and `Boss`

### 2. Progressive Learning Path
1. Start with basic utility functions
2. Introduce simple classes (`Weapon`)
3. Build more complex classes with relationships (`Character`, `Boss`)
4. Show how classes interact in the `Game` class

### 3. Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper use of Python's module system


### Areas That Could Be Challenging 

1. **Multiple Classes at Once**
   - The code introduces several classes simultaneously, which might be overwhelming
   - A more step-by-step approach might build one class at a time

2. **Some Advanced Concepts**
   - Static methods (`@staticmethod`) might need additional explanation
   - The distinction between composition and dependency might be subtle for beginners

3. **Limited Visibility Examples**
   - Doesn't demonstrate private/protected attributes with Python's underscore convention
   - Missing encapsulation examples with getters/setters

## Development

### Setting Up for Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 11SE_OOP_RPG_BLEH
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

To run tests with coverage report:
```bash
pytest --cov=.
```

To run a specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/test_character.py
```

To run a specific test case:
```bash
pytest tests/test_character.py::TestCharacter::test_character_creation
```

## Learning Recommendations

### Suggested Learning Approach
1. **Start with the Big Picture**
   - Play the game in action
   - Discuss with a peer the overall architecture and class relationships

2. **Progressive Implementation**
   - Begin with the `Weapon` class (simplest)
   - Move to `Character` class and introduce encapsulation
   - Show inheritance with the `Boss` class
   - Finally, demonstrate the `Game` class that ties everything together

3. **Hands-On**
   - Extend the `Character` class with new abilities
   - Implement a new weapon type with special effects
   - Add a new game mechanic using the existing class structure

4. **Code Review**
   - Walk through the code together with a peer, discussing design decisions
   - Highlight good practices and potential improvements
   - Connect the implementation to the corresponding UML diagram

## Future Enhancements

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned improvements, including:
- Refactoring into a multi-file package structure
- Adding new character types and abilities
- Implementing an inventory system
- Enhancing the combat system
